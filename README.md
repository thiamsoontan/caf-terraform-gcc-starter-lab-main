# Cloud Adoption Framework landing zones for Terraform - GCC Starter Kit

Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure provides you with guidance and best practices to adopt Azure.

A landing zone is a segment of a cloud environment, that has been preprovisioned through code, and is dedicated to the support of one or more workloads. Landing zones provide access to foundational tools and controls to establish a compliant place to innovate and build new workloads in the cloud, or to migrate existing workloads to the cloud. Landing zones use defined sets of cloud services and best practices to set you up for success.

## :rocket: Getting started: go read the docs!

When starting an enterprise deployment, we recommend you start creating a configuration repository where you craft the configuration files for your environments.

The best way to start is to clone the platform starter repository and getting started with the configuration files. This repository helps you create the level 3 and level 4 - applications in the CAF Terraform model.

We recommend that you review the documentation: ðŸ“š Read our centralized documentation page
